    caption: The simple user interface hides a lot of complexity. Fore example, each location must be checked against existing listings and verified using a poorly documented API.

Brick and mortar business owners spend hours every month updating their business information across multiple platforms. We identified this pain point and saw an opportunity to deliver on Squarespace’s promise to be an all-in-one platform for business by making this easier. 

The result was Location Manager, a new feature where users enter their business information once and automatically sync it across multiple location service providers like Google, Facebook, and Yelp. I worked closely with platform partners and wrestled piles of API documentation to design a system that is simple to use but flexible enough to accommodate a diverse range of current and future service providers. 

Now in beta, Location Manager enables our users to manage their online details in one place, saving them time and letting them focus on what really matters – their business.

- **25k+** locations created
- **Hours and hours** of time saved
