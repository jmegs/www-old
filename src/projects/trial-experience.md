During their trial period, new Squarespace users are faced with learning a lot of new information and making decisions about their brand quickly. My team’s mission is to help new users find value with Squarespace during their free trial period, ultimately contributing to increased conversion rates and happy members. In addition, what we learn about the needs and pain points of new users has a direct benefit to other teams. 

To accomplish these goals, my team has established a new (to Squarespace) way of working based on fast experimentation and learning. We, along with our UX research team, have run lots of experiments that, while not always improving conversion, have netted important learning for the organization. Highlights include:

- A new user quiz that helps Squarespace understand customer needs and goals, with the goal of enabling users to select the best template for them.
- An easy-to-access “Assistant” that guides users during onboarding, suggesting next steps and feature topics to explore.
- A new onboarding flow that teaches the “building blocks” of the Squarespace editor.
- A framework to enable targeted in-product surveys.

While this is an iterative process where learning is valued over positive outcomes, we have already seen business impact from this work.

- **Significant Increases** in trial conversion
- **Millions** of new customer data points unlocked for other teams
