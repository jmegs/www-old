    caption: The new client list highlights progress over time. Trainers can see all the important business and fitness metrics for every client. This used to span several apps and sites.

Equinox customers got world-class fitness instruction, but they weren’t renewing their training memberships. Trainers got world-class fitness education, but trainer turnover was high. How could we solve this retention problem — helping both groups see enough value to stay?

After an immersive research sprint (where we all got in great shape), we found that trainers were distracted by redundant tools and workflows and therefore limited in the value they could deliver to their clients. 

Working together with a group of elite trainers — who reviewed a working prototype after every two week sprint — we designed a unified solution for existing client management, workout programming, and admin needs. Besides streamlining the basics, we added a new feature called milestone tracking letting trainers deliver tangible value directly to their client’s home screen.

- **4.5/5** stars from trainers
- **100%** said it will be valuable for their clients
