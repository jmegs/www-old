Currently a Senior Product Designer at [Squarespace], John specializes in clarifying complex ecosystems, building digital experiences in physical spaces, and prototyping ideas in code.

On the Trial Experience team at Squarespace he creates onboarding, educational features, and cross-team collaborations that enable a coherent user experience across the full product and drive business growth. Additionally, he builds tools and processes that empower collaboration between designers and engineers.

Previously he worked in Experience Design at [R/GA], building products and tech-enabled consumer experiences for the world’s biggest brands like Samsung, Mercedes, Equinox, and Verizon.

When not drawing rectangles on screen, he's a passionate home cook, restaurant goer, and lover of interior design, prestige tv, and hikes – especially ones that end at a great place to eat.
